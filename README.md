In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of the Adult Income Dataset using Python.

**Data Preprocessing with Python**:
Used Pandas for data cleaning—handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling—to prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
Performed EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize distributions, detect outliers, and understand relationships between income and features such as education, occupation, and hours-per-week.
